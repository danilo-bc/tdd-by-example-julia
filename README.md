# tdd-by-example-julia
Adaptation of TDD by Example by Kent Beck from Java to Julia

## Motivation
Learning TDD and adapting class-based OOP to Julia are challenging to me. I decided to hop along the small steps proposed by the book and come up with an initial solution that can be reviewed and improved.

## Organization
I intend to put each example in a folder with the respective name. Currently, I only tried the Money example.
Inside each folder, there'll be subfolders with the chapter number so I can keep track of the tests I tried to cover and the deltas between iterations and new tests.
